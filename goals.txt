Great initiative — you're aiming for **more than just a tech demo**. You want a **focused, no-database**, full-stack app that:

* Pulls real-time data from **Bitcoin** and **Kaspa**
* Uses **Spring Boot** to apply meaningful business logic (not just proxy)
* Connects to a **React frontend**
* Is **unique enough** to spark recruiter/EM interest

---

## 🎯 Idea: **"Fairness Feed" – A Live Block Fee Market Comparator**

**📝 One-liner:**

> *A live, comparative dashboard of Bitcoin and Kaspa block economics — measuring decentralization signals through miner fee behavior.*

---

### 🧠 Concept

You're not just forwarding blocks and transactions — you **analyze and compare**:

* **Miner fee collection** patterns
* **Mempool congestion** pressure
* **Block propagation lag**
* **TX size vs. fee efficiency**
* **Tx throughput vs. latency**

Then you stream **enriched, computed insights** to the frontend — all in real-time.

## 🔧 Business Logic You Can Implement (No DB Required)

### 📊 Fee Market Comparator

* Compare **fees per byte** for each confirmed transaction
* Highlight outliers: sudden surges in fee levels, spam TXs
* Detect patterns: block full but low fee? Fee war?

### 🚦 “Congestion Heat”

* Calculate mempool size relative to historical average (rolling)
* Create a “network congestion barometer” per chain

### 🔁 Block Propagation Diff

* Measure delay between new block on Kaspa vs Bitcoin
* Calculate block frequency and block size correlation

### 📈 Fairness Score

* Calculate how fair a block is based on:

  * % of high-fee txs accepted
  * % of mempool cleared
  * Miner fee-to-size ratio

---

## 🔥 Bonus “Recruiter Hooks”

### 🧠 Advanced Engineering

* 🧮 Stateless real-time analytics without DB
* 📡 Reactive streaming using Spring WebSocket
* 🌐 Integrates 2 blockchains (Bitcoin, Kaspa)
* 📊 Rich, real-time React frontend

### ✨ Showcase Potential

Include a README with:

* A few sample screenshots
* “What’s interesting here” bullets
* How you engineered it for real-time analysis

## ✅ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Frontend     | React + Tailwind + Chart.js |
| Backend      | Spring Boot WebSocket app   |
| Integrations | Bitcoin RPC / Kaspa wRPC    |
| Infra        | No DB, lightweight          |

---

## 🧪 Optional (If Time Allows)

* Implement a **“Fee Simulator”**: user submits mock TXs with fee levels, system predicts whether it'd get included in next block.
* Create a “Who’s More Congested?” widget — a head-to-head of Bitcoin vs Kaspa.

---

## 🚀 Summary

Build a **real-time comparative dashboard** that:

* Streams block/mempool data from both chains
* Analyzes the **fee economy and congestion**
* Pushes actionable metrics via WebSocket
* Has **no database**, only in-memory analytics
* Has a clean, focused codebase that's **impressive and insightful**
